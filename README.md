# [The Development of an Algorithm to Create a Batting Lineup for a Major League Team](https://www.kaggle.com/bassballfever/capstone)

* Created a tool that maximizes the expected runs scored by setting the batting order for a starting MLB lineup.
* Compared Simulated Annealing and a Genetic Algorithm and concluded that the Genetic Algorithm performed best in this situation.
* Created a simulator to estimate the number of runs a batting lineup will score in a season using Python.
* Optimized metaheuristics of the Genetic Algorithm to produce the best results.
* Used Tableau and Photoshop to produce figures.

# [The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip](https://www.kaggle.com/bassballfever/ultimate-baseball-road-trip)

* Used Simulated Annealing to find the shortest distance required to visit every MLB ballpark.
* Created a JSON file to store the distance matrix and information about each ballpark.
* Produced a map showing the route as well as an ordered list of ballparks.
* Used in a [series of articles](https://theaosn.com/the-ultimate-baseball-road-trip/) as the basis for a potential 2020 road trip.
