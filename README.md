## [The Development of an Algorithm to Create a Batting Lineup for a Major League Team](https://www.kaggle.com/bassballfever/capstone)
### Optimization, Simulation, Model Selection, Model Tuning, Python (libraries: matplotlib, numpy, pandas), Tableau

![](/images/capstone.png)

* Created a tool that maximizes the expected runs scored by setting the batting order for a starting MLB lineup.
* Compared Simulated Annealing and a Genetic Algorithm and concluded that the Genetic Algorithm performed best in this situation.
* Created a simulator to estimate the number of runs a batting lineup will score in a season using Python.
* Optimized metaheuristics of the Genetic Algorithm to produce the best results.
* Used Tableau and Photoshop to produce figures.

## [Fargo Health Group Forecast](https://github.com/BassBallFever/fargo)
### Data Wrangling, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, Model Selection, R

![](/images/holtwinters.png)

* Transformed data from multiple sources into a consistent format.
* Imputed missing values using weighted averages.
* Forecasted the next 12 months.
* Created a narrated [PowerPoint](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X7uiR9VIeruS1ajpb3UKMPOQ7J9BVjvR) presentation to demonstrate findings.

## [The Ultimate Baseball Road Trip](https://www.kaggle.com/bassballfever/ultimate-baseball-road-trip)
### Optimization, Python (Libraries: matplotlib, numpy, json)

![](/images/roadtrip.png)

* Used Simulated Annealing to find the shortest distance required to visit every MLB ballpark.
* Created a JSON file to store the distance matrix and information about each ballpark.
* Produced a map showing the route as well as an ordered list of ballparks.
* Used in a [series of articles](https://theaosn.com/the-ultimate-baseball-road-trip/) as the basis for a potential 2020 road trip.

## [Loan Classification](https://github.com/BassBallFever/loan-classification)
### Classification, EDA, Data Wrangling, Feature Selection, Logistic Regressioin, R (Libraries: dplyr, ggformula, mice, HH, leaps), R Markdown

![](/images/loan1.jpg)

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Selected features to be used in the model.
* Performed logistic regression on the data.
* Compared model optimized for accuracy to model optimized for profits.
* Created [R Markdown file](https://github.com/BassBallFever/loan-classification/blob/master/loans.Rmd) to document findings.
* [Final Document](https://github.com/BassBallFever/loan-classification/blob/master/LoanClassification.docx)

## [Star Wars Network](https://github.com/BassBallFever/starwars)
### Network Analysis, Network Modelling, Feature Engineering, R (Libraries: igraph, statnet, ergm, intergraph, jsonlite)

![](/images/starwars.png)

* Converted JSON file to csv format.
* Performed Centrality Analysis.
* Performed Community Detection.
* Selected features for the model.
* Selected dyadic predictor for the model.
* Examined dyad dependency.
* Analyzed model fit.
